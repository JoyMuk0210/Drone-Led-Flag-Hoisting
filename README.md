# 🚁Drone-Mounted Flag Hoisting Mechanism

A custom-built **servo-based flag hoisting mechanism** designed and installed on an institutional drone for the **Independence Day flag hoisting ceremony at NIT Warangal**.  

This project focused on creating a reliable and synchronized flag release system, integrated with the drone’s structure, while ensuring stable aerial performance during the ceremony.

## ✨ Features
- 🎌 Flag hoisting using a servo-based uncoiling mechanism  
- 🔧 Compact and lightweight design integrated with drone landing gear  
- 🎮 Remote-controlled servo triggering synchronized with pilot’s commands  
- 🚁 Works mid-air while drone maintains hover stability  

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Used
- **Drone (provided by institute)** – platform for mounting mechanism  
- **Flag hoisting mechanism (designed by our team):**  
  - Shaft connected to drone stands  
  - **3× MG996R Servo Motors** for flag support and release  
  - Coiled flag mounting system with one side fixed to shaft  
- Flag (cloth, ceremonial)  

---

## 💻 Software / Control
- Servos controlled via drone pilot’s transmitter  
- Embedded control circuit for servo actuation  
- **Mission Planner** for drone operation and stability monitoring  
- Basic Arduino/servo control logic for testing and calibration

## ⚙️ How the Mechanism Works
1. The flag is **coiled around a shaft** connected to the drone’s landing stands.  
2. **Three MG996R servos** extend supports to hold the coiled flag in place.  
3. Once the drone is stable mid-air, the pilot **triggers the servos remotely**.  
4. The servos **retract the supports**, releasing the coil.  
5. The flag **unfurls and hoists naturally** under gravity, creating the ceremonial effect.
